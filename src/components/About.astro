  <p class="mt-4">
    I'm Joaquin. I have always been fascinated by the way computers work and the
    endless possibilities of what can be achieved through code. This interest
    has led me to the creation of multiple applications.

  <p class="mt-4">
    Besides, I am also interested in machine learning. I have trained my own
    model using

    and used it in one of my apps. (<a

  <p class="mt-4">
    In addition to always researching new tech, I am involved
    in the open source community. I believe in the power of collaboration and
    sharing knowledge, and I find great joy in contributing to projects and
    learning from others in the community.
